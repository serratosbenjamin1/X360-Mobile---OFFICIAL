Welcome to the official repository of **X360 Mobile**, an experimental, native Xbox 360 emulator built specifically for the Android platform. Developed using modern ARM64 and Vulkan 1.3 technologies, X360 Mobile is the **pioneer in natively utilizing the highly acclaimed Xenia Canary core on Android**, delivering advanced optimization and high performance directly to your high-end mobile devices.

> [!NOTE]
> **Repository Purpose:** 
> To safeguard the codebase and maintain proprietary performance enhancements, **X360 Mobile is closed-source**. This official repository does not contain the emulator's source code. Instead, it serves as the **official version archive and primary distribution platform** for releasing APK builds, managing compatibility issues, and sharing user guides.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Native Xenia Canary Foundation:** The very first Android emulator natively designed around Xenia Canary from inception, rather than migrating from Xenia Master, ensuring superior architecture and performance.
* **Modern Vulkan Backend:** Leverages Vulkan 1.3 to deliver optimal hardware utilization, high frame rates, and low overhead.
* **Custom Touch Overlay:** Fully customizable virtual gamepads with haptic feedback, fluid analog response, and tailored layouts for any screen size.
* **Physical Controller Support:** Seamless plug-and-play support for physical controllers via Bluetooth or USB-OTG (including Xbox Series X|S, DualSense, DualShock 4, and major mobile controllers).
* **Game-Specific Profiles:** Adjust resolutions, shader compilation options, and memory constraints individually per game to squeeze every bit of power from your device.
* **Performance Enhancements:** Integrated translation of PowerPC assembly to ARM64 instructions with specific micro-optimizations for Snapdragon and Dimensity chipsets.

## 📱 System Requirements

Xbox 360 emulation is an experimental and computationally intense process requiring sophisticated hardware translation. Please check the requirements below to understand your device's expected performance.

| Specification | Minimum Requirements | Recommended (For Playable Speeds) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Android 12 (64-bit) | Android 13 or newer (64-bit) |
| **Processor & GPU** | Qualcomm Snapdragon with Adreno GPU (600/700/800 series) | High-end Qualcomm Snapdragon (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or higher recommended) |
| **RAM (Memory)** | 6 GB RAM | 8 GB - 12 GB RAM (or higher) |
| **Storage (Speed)** | High-speed storage (UFS 3.1 or superior recommended) | Ultra-fast UFS 3.1/4.0 storage |

> [!WARNING]
> Devices utilizing processors with Mali GPUs, Samsung's Xclipse GPUs (AMD RDNA-based), older Adreno GPUs (prior to the 600 series), or entry-level/low-end chipsets will experience severe performance limitations, visual glitches, heavy thermal throttling, or crashes. A modern Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with an Adreno GPU is highly recommended for optimal results.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is X360 Mobile free?
**Yes.** X360 Mobile is free to download and use. We do not charge fees, nor do we include intrusive ads that ruin the gaming experience.

### Why is the project closed-source?
We made the choice to keep X360 Mobile closed-source to prevent fraudulent forks, malicious repackaging (e.g., injecting adware/spyware into our builds), and to protect our proprietary ARM64 conversion pipeline and compiler optimizations. We want to ensure that users receive only secure, highly optimized, and officially signed packages directly from this repository or our official website.

### Is X360 Mobile related to the desktop Xenia project?
X360 Mobile is built upon the incredible codebase of **Xenia Canary** (an open-source project for PC). We have ported, refactored, and optimized their core rendering and execution engines to run on Android. We hold the utmost respect for the original Xenia developers and aim to deliver the same high-standard experience on mobile devices.

### What games can I run right now?
Compatibility is an ongoing effort. Currently, **over 300 titles have been tested**, out of which approximately **40% are fully playable**. 

For a complete and up-to-date compatibility list, please visit our official website at [www.x360mobile.com](https://www.x360mobile.com). While classic Arcade titles, indie games, and lighter 3D games run very well, demanding AAA titles (such as *Red Dead Redemption*, *Halo 3*, or *Gears of War*) are bootable and can achieve playable speeds on the latest flagship Snapdragon processors, though they may still exhibit minor graphical bugs or frame drops.
